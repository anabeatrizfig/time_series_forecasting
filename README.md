Technique of forecasting values of a time series - open source; relatively simple to apply and flexible.

## How it works:
- from a historical data, it decomposes the values into:
TREND + SEASONALITY (year | month | day of the week | holidays)
- to create a pattern and make the projection

## Application:
- Make a more reliable forecast for OPEN TV audience values
- Daily data since 2001 - segmented by Daypart
 
## Test:
